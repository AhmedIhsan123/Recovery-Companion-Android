# Recovery Companion

Recovery Companion is a serious, Android self-care application focused on addiction recovery, emotional reflection, and urge management — without gamification.

The app is designed for users who view self-care as a disciplined, private, and long-term process rather than a game.

---

## Motivation

Many existing self-care applications rely on mascots, rewards, and playful visuals that trivialize addiction recovery and emotional regulation. For users who want a calm, respectful, and focused environment, these solutions often feel distracting or inappropriate.

Recovery Companion addresses this gap by offering a minimal, dark-mode experience centered on progress, accountability, and reflection.
